# The Blog Cabin
## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
I built this site to showcase the ability to program a checkbox to look switch from a light mode to a dark mode. It is also capable of logging a username, title and content to post to a blog page. It functions as a basic blog! I learned about the capabilities of using javascript in a seemingly limited way. If you can think of something you want to happen on your page, you can certainly make it happen.


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Usage

Type in a username, title and what you're feeling today and it will post to the blog page when you hit the submit button. On either page you can enable the dark mode by clicking the slider! On the posts page you can also click the back button to add another post!

## Credits

I collaborated with some of my classmates and teachers. They were able to help me understand and make this webpage. I also used information from the dark mode slider from the class activities. I was able to rework some of the function to apply it to my webpage!
